Please do not copy `netlify.toml` directly from here. You should use the content [here](https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola/blob/main/netlify.example.toml) for your `netlify.toml`. This setup uses the development branch which might contain unstable / WIP features. Of course, if you are feeling adventurous then why not :)
